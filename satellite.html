  <h1>Los Altos Rotary Satellite Club</h1>

  <p>We're a small, hands-on team within the broader Los Altos Rotary family, created for people who want to serve the community with a more flexible rhythm. As part of an established club, we benefit from a welcoming network, mentorship, and the ability to take on meaningful local projects right away.</p>

  <p>Our meeting cadence is designed for busy schedules. Instead of weekly noon meetings, we gather once a month and stay connected in between through online updates and a WhatsApp group. This helps members participate consistently while balancing work, family, and life.</p>

  <p>We focus on projects that make a visible difference close to home. A recent example: curating and distributing inclusive, neurodiversity-affirming books to local schools and Little Free Libraries. We aim for efforts that are thoughtful, inclusive, and practical—projects you can feel proud to be part of.</p>

  <p>Our members come from a wide mix of backgrounds—healthcare, education, tech, business, communications, and more. What unites us is a shared desire to put skills to work for good, learn from one another, and create a welcoming space for all who want to contribute.</p>

  <p>Because we're growing, there's room to help shape what comes next: which projects we prioritize, how we meet, and the culture we build together. If you're looking for a way to get involved that fits your life—and lets you make a real impact—we'd love to meet you.</p>
